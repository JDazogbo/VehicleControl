## Overview

This repository contains a simulation-based study of vehicle power management systems, developed using a combination of CarSim for high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulation and MATLAB/Simulink's Vehicle Dynamics Blockset. The focus is on modeling the electro-mechanical dynamics of Electric Vehicles (EVs) to develop adaptive controllers capable of leveraging existing knoweledge of the environment to optimise the system's energy expenditure.

## Code Structure

_Work in progress — this section will be updated as the repository evolves._
