## Overview

This repository contains a simulation-based study of vehicle power management systems, developed using a combination of CarSim for high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulation and MATLAB/Simulink's Vehicle Dynamics Blockset. The focus is on modeling the electro-mechanical dynamics of Electric Vehicles (EVs) to develop adaptive controllers capable of leveraging existing knoweledge of the environment to optimise the system's energy expenditure.

## Repository Structure

The [`EVLQR`](./EVLQR) directory contains all the materials related to the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)-based energy management controller. Inside, you'll find scripts such as `LQRSolver.m` for solving the LQR control problem, as well as the main Simulink model [`VehicleEnergyManagementSystem.slx`](./EVLQR/VehicleEnergyManagementSystem.slx), which implements the electric vehicle control architecture.

The [`MMAE`](./MMAE) folder includes tools and files for Multi-Model Adaptive Estimator. Of particular importance is the Simulink toolbox [`MultiModelToolbox.slx`](./MMAE/MultiModelToolbox.slx), which enables dynamic model switching and parameter estimation within the simulation environment.

The [`Ressources`](./Ressources) folder contains supporting materials for the project. Within it, the [`Images`](./Ressources/Images) subfolder holds all figures and visual assets used in the report. The [`Derivations`](./Ressources/Derivations) subfolder includes the [Vehicle and Road Friction State Space Model Derivation](Ressources/Derivations/VehicleRoadStateSpace.pdf) upon which the control problem is vehicle dynamics based.
